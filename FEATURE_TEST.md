# Feature Testing Results

## Matches Feature - Database-Only Implementation

### How It Works
1. **Database Function**: Uses `find_matches_for_user(user_id)` PostgreSQL function
2. **Matching Logic**: Scores properties based on:
   - City match: 30 points
   - Property type match: 25 points
   - Price match: 25 points (property price <= user's max_price)
   - Bedrooms match: 20 points (property rooms >= user's bedrooms)
3. **Minimum Score**: 50% (50 points) required to show match
4. **No External Dependencies**: Works entirely through Supabase database

### Testing Steps

#### Test 1: Create User with Survey
```
1. Sign up: test-match@example.com / password123
2. Complete survey:
   - City: Bangalore
   - Max Price: 10,000,000 (10M)
   - Type: apartment
   - Size: Any
   - Bedrooms: 2

Expected Results:
- Should match 2 properties in Bangalore:
  * 2BHK Apartment in Indiranagar (6.5M, 2 BHK) - Score: 80%
  * 3BHK Apartment in Koramangala (8.5M, 3 BHK) - Score: 80%
```

#### Test 2: Manual Match Check
```
1. Go to Matches tab
2. Click "Check Matches" button

Expected Console Logs:
- "Finding matches for user: [user-id]"
- "Found matches: 2"
- "Creating 2 match records"
- "Match records created successfully"

Expected UI:
- Shows: "Found 2 new property matches!"
- Displays 2 property cards with match scores
- Each card shows "NEW" badge
```

#### Test 3: Verify Match Display
```
1. Check Matches tab
2. Verify each match shows:
   - Property image
   - Title, location, price
   - Match Score: X%
   - NEW badge (for unviewed)

3. Click on a property
4. Badge should disappear (marked as viewed)
```

#### Test 4: Different Preferences
```
1. Sign up: test-villa@example.com / password123
2. Complete survey:
   - City: Goa
   - Max Price: 40,000,000 (40M)
   - Type: villa
   - Bedrooms: 3

Expected Matches:
- Luxury Villa in Assagao (12M, 4 BHK) - Score: 80%
- Beachfront Villa in Candolim (35M, 3 BHK) - Score: 80%
```

### Match Scoring Examples

**Perfect Match (100%)**:
- City: Bangalore ✓ (30pts)
- Type: apartment ✓ (25pts)
- Price: 6.5M <= 10M ✓ (25pts)
- Bedrooms: 2 >= 2 ✓ (20pts)
- Total: 100 points = 100%

**Good Match (80%)**:
- City: Bangalore ✓ (30pts)
- Type: apartment ✓ (25pts)
- Price: 8.5M <= 10M ✓ (25pts)
- Bedrooms: 3 >= 2 ✓ (20pts but user wanted 2)
- Total: 80 points = 80%

**Minimum Match (50%)**:
- City: Bangalore ✓ (30pts)
- Type: villa ✗ (0pts - wanted apartment)
- Price: 8.5M <= 10M ✓ (25pts)
- Bedrooms: 2 >= 2 ✗ (0pts - user wanted 3)
- Total: 55 points = 55%

## Chat Feature - Webhook Integration

### How It Works
1. **User Message**: Sent to n8n webhook at `http://localhost:5678/webhook/chat`
2. **Payload Format**:
   ```json
   {
     "event": "chat",
     "user_id": "uuid",
     "message": "user's message"
   }
   ```
3. **Response Handling**: Reads `response` field from JSON
4. **Fallback**: If webhook fails, uses intelligent local responses

### Testing Steps

#### Test 1: Webhook Available
```
Setup:
1. Have n8n running on localhost:5678
2. Configure webhook endpoint: /webhook/chat
3. Return JSON: { "response": "Your custom response here" }

Test:
1. Login to app
2. Go to Chat tab
3. Type: "Hello"
4. Send message

Expected Console Logs:
- POST to http://localhost:5678/webhook/chat
- "Webhook response: { response: '...' }"

Expected UI:
- User message appears on right (blue)
- Bot response appears on left (white/gray)
- Bot displays: "Your custom response here"
- Timestamp shown
```

#### Test 2: Webhook Unavailable (Fallback)
```
Setup:
1. Stop n8n or use wrong URL

Test:
1. Go to Chat tab
2. Type: "Hello"
3. Send message

Expected Console Logs:
- "Webhook error, using fallback response"

Expected UI:
- Shows fallback: "Hello! I'm your property assistant..."
- Chat still works normally
- No errors displayed to user
```

#### Test 3: Various Message Types
```
Test Messages and Expected Fallback Responses:

1. "Hello" → "Hello! I'm your property assistant..."
2. "Show me properties in Bangalore" → "Great choice! Bangalore has excellent properties..."
3. "What's the price?" → "I can help you with pricing information..."
4. "I want an apartment" → "Excellent! I can show you some great options..."
5. "Show me matches" → "To see personalized property matches..."
```

#### Test 4: Response Field Priority
```
Webhook returns multiple fields:
{
  "response": "This should be shown",
  "reply": "Not this",
  "message": "Or this"
}

Expected: Displays "This should be shown"

Priority Order:
1. response (primary)
2. reply (secondary)
3. message (tertiary)
```

### Chat UI Features

**Message Display**:
- User messages: Right-aligned, blue background
- Bot messages: Left-aligned, white/gray background
- Avatars: User icon (blue) / Bot icon (gray)
- Timestamps: Below each message
- Auto-scroll: To newest message

**Loading State**:
- Three bouncing dots while waiting
- Bot avatar shown
- Smooth animation

**Error Handling**:
- Webhook errors: Silent, uses fallback
- No error messages shown to user
- Console logs for debugging

### Verification Checklist

- [x] Sends POST to correct webhook URL
- [x] Includes event, user_id, message in payload
- [x] Reads "response" field from JSON
- [x] Fallback responses work
- [x] Messages save to database
- [x] Chat history persists
- [x] UI updates in real-time
- [x] Loading indicators shown
- [x] Auto-scrolling works
- [x] Timestamps display correctly
